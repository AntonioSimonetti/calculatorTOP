**Project: Calculator**

*Calulator created for The Odin Project curriculum.*

LIVE VERSION: https://antoniosimonetti.github.io/calculatorTOP/

This is my third HTML/CSS/JS project.

**PROJECT IDEA**

The idea was to create a simple calculator. The goal I set myself was to try to do something more on the graphic side using a specific graphic style 
and try to make it usable for other types of devices as well.

*-CSS-*

I used both flexbox and grid. I also had the opportunity to test the usefulness of flexbox's order command as well as do something more with css animations and hover


*-JS-*

I had the chance to train classes and objects a lot as well as eventlistners and DOM manipulation

**Improvements for the future:**

I definitely need to improve in the design of the website and in thinking first about how to build it to make it 100% responsive even for mobile devices. 
Most of the work I have to do, however, remains on JS. I do not miss understanding the code but I have to improve about the logical part project in its entirety and not throw myself into many small parts and hope that putting them together will work

**Good things to look at:**

I am developing more and more confidence with all the tools that CSS makes available to me. I feel I have made great progress in this part.
Although I see less progress made with JS than CSS, even with this language I am making progress, this is fine for now.
