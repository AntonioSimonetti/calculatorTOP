# Project: Calculator

Calulator creataed for The Odin Project curriculum.

LIVE VERSION: https://antoniosimonetti.github.io/calculatorTOP/

This is my third HTML/CSS/JS project.

THE IDEA


The idea was to create a simple calculator. The goal I set myself was to try to do something more on the graphic side using a specific graphic style 
and try to make it usable for other types of devices as well.



-CSS-



-JS-

I learned how to toggle boolean values stored into variables. I learned how to prevent event happening on some elements using the tagName.

Improvements for the future:



Good things to look at:
